## Workshop Setup

Before starting the workshop, please run the following in the terminal. It will install all of the required dependencies. (More on that later.)

Type `ctrl`+ `j` to open the terminal inside of VS Code.

```bash
yarn install
```

In order to more easily evaluate your answers, you will need a `node` environment. VS Code provides us with a terminal, and in the terminal we can evaluate js files with Node.

It really **NOT** recommended that you use the browser console.

> 💡 You can toggle the terminal window in VS Code with the following keyboard shortcut:
>
> - `[ctrl + j]` on Windows
> - `[cmd + j]` on Mac

This will open an instance of the terminal (Mac) or the PowerShell (Win).

## Type JS directly into the Node Env.

- Type the following in the terminal, and hit `enter`.

```bash
node 2-workshop/exercise-3.js
```

This will execute all of the code in the `exercise-3.js` file.

## Testing

This workshop can "test" your code and validate your answers. (We will talk more about this later.)

If you want to test your code/validate your answer, you can type `yarn test <FILE_NAME>` in the terminal (without the `.js`).

In this workshop, there will be a reminder to do this at the end of every exercise file.

If you want to test all the exercises in the `75% checkpoint` run the command `yarn test-75`.

If you want to test all the exercises in the `100% checkpoint` run the command `yarn test-100`.

If you want to test all the exercises including stretch goals, run the command `yarn test`.
